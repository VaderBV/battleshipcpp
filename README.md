## Introduction:
Battleship is a guessing game for two players. It is played on
ruled grids on which each player’s fleet of ships are marked.
The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other
player. Players alternate turns calling &quot;shots&quot; at the other
player&#39;s ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the
opposing player&#39;s fleet. This is a modern version of Battleship
developed using C++ programming language
